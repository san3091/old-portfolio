### TODO
* Add bass synth plus controls and extra center shape animation
* Add filter and vibrato controls for bass? (drag bass knob wrapper and map x to filter frew and y to vibrato (?))
* Add control over arp frequency
  * drag knob wrapper controls mapping y to arp speed and maybe x to scale?)
  * have a set of mabe 5 pentatonic-y scales that work well with each other, map to sections of x
  * modify transport bpm with y axis
