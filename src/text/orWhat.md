# Or What

- inspired by Ohad Fishof and Noa Zuk's process for Shutdown
- researching seduction and sensuality
- constantly changing object and form
  - drawing in observer, pushing away
  - focus on observer, focus on self
  - conventional "sexy" movement, versus weirder movement that feels good but maybe does not code as sexy.
- no necessarily linear narrative, back and forth
- more research in spatial mapping and focus
- divided and choppy--probably reflects my relationship with sensuality as compartmentalized and separated


What does seduction really look like? was the question I took to the studio for the creation of Or What. I want to arrive to my movement vocabulary in the performance of seduction. I began with Rosie Herrera's exercise of demanding maximum pleasure and moving from that place, and researching when I moved from an internal sensation of pleasure and when it became drawing pleasure from a form that reads like pleasure. Both felt like valid ways of demanding pleasure, but the pathways were decidedly different--physicality to sensation, and sensation to physicality.
